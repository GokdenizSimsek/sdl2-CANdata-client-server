This system consists of a WebSocket-based client and server designed for real-time joystick-controlled CAN data transmission. The client reads steering and propulsion input from a joystick using SDL2, maps the input to appropriate CAN signal ranges, and formats them into CAN frame strings. These frames are sent to the server via a persistent WebSocket connection. A separate thread on the client periodically sends "ping" messages to ensure the connection is alive and triggers reconnection if needed. The server listens for incoming WebSocket connections, parses received CAN frame strings into structured data, and sends them over a serial COM port at regular intervals (every 100 ms), ensuring reliable and continuous transmission of both steering and propulsion data to downstream systems.
